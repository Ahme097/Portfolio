	<h1>Welcome to the Stars website!</h1>
	<p>On this site, you can learn about the different types of stars, their characteristics, and how they form and evolve.</p>
	<h2>Types of Stars</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Red dwarfs</li>
		<li>Yellow dwarfs</li>
		<li>Red giants</li>
		<li>White dwarfs</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Star Characteristics</h2>
	<p>Stars are classified based on their temperature, mass, and other physical properties. Some common characteristics of stars include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Luminosity</li>
		<li>Temperature</li>
		<li>Mass</li>
		<li>Radius</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>How Stars Form and Evolve</h2>
	<p>Stars are formed from clouds of gas and dust in space, called nebulae. As the clouds collapse under their own gravity, they begin to spin and heat up. Eventually, the temperature and pressure at the center of the collapsing cloud become so high that nuclear fusion begins, and a star is born.</p>
	<p>Stars spend most of their lives in the main sequence, during which they convert hydrogen into helium in their cores through nuclear fusion. As the star ages, it will eventually exhaust its supply of hydrogen and evolve into a different type of star, such as a red giant or white dwarf.</p>
